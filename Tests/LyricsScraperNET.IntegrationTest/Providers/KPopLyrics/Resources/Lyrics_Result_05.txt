[Daehwi] Woo
Ha yeah (Umm)
[Hyunjin] Psycho

[Bomin] What should I do about you?
I haven’t felt this way
[Daehwi] Up and down a lot, I can’t control myself
One thing is for sure I don’t play the game

[Hyunjin] People say we’re so weird
I just like you so much
[Sanha] You know it so well and control me
So do I

[Hyunjin] We’re in a very weird and strange relationship
We crush each other ([Daehwi] crush)
[Sanha] And hug each other ([Daehwi] and hug)

[All] You got me feeling like a psycho psycho
People keep telling us
As we fight like it’s our last but then we get along
They don’t get it, it’s so funny

[All] Right, psycho psycho
We’re fools loving each other so much
Without you I feel dizzy and sad I feel low
People say we make a cute couple, hey now we’ll be ok

[Bomin] Hey trouble, you come without even a warning
I’m original visual, this is who we are yeah
[Daehwi] I’m not afraid (just find it interesting)
[Hyunjin] It’s hot! Let me just hop
How can I handle you? Ooh

[Daehwi] I don’t know what to do
Even if I calm you down and harshly kick you
[Bomin] You sometimes smile at me
How can I let you go? Ooh

[Hyunjin] We’re in a beautiful and sad relationship
We make each other shine ([Sanha] Tell me now)
Like the moon and the river
[Daehwi] And we hug again

[All] You got me feeling like a psycho psycho
People keep telling us
As we fight like it’s our last but then we get along
They don’t get it, it’s so funny

[All] Right, psycho psycho
We’re fools loving each other so much
Without you I feel dizzy and sad I feel low
People say we make a cute couple, hey now we’ll be ok

[Bomin] Don’t look back
Like that let’s be who we are
[Sanha] I feel you with all my body
Everything will be ok

([Daehwi] You got me feeling like a psycho)
[All] Like a psycho psycho
People keep telling us
As we fight like it’s our last but then we get along
People say we make a cute couple, hey now we’ll be ok

[All] Hey now we’ll be ok
Hey now we’ll be ok
Hey now we’ll be ok
Hey now we’ll be ok

[All] It’s alright
