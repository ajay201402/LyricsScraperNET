La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la (la la)
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

The light that wakes me up, the space that’s meant for me
A place that’s just for me in your heart
I like to stick (stick)
A secretive trick (trick)
I’m holding on tight to your heart
I remember it all
The words I shared when times were tough
On nights like those, I’ve got a lot to do
Make you forget

This is an untold story
From the other side of a dream
I fake that you’re really gonna dream that
A story we stay up all night to create and leave behind
Sweet dream

Sometimes I dive into your dream
Though I can’t stay there forever
Sometimes I cry to make you smile
Even though we may not know every side of each other
I want to make you smile more
I want to know you longer
Please remember only the good things, my precious you

Shh, listen to me
I’m back at the starting point again
An echo rings out in the twilight
Honestly, you’re curious too
I feel like low-key
Not that I know of, but I will keep dancing
Until your beautiful smile appears
(nonstop)

This is a story from deep within my heart
That can’t be revealed
I fake that you’re really gonna dream that
A story that becomes more beautiful
The longer it stays a secret
Sweet dream

Sometimes I dive into your dream
Though I can’t stay there forever
Sometimes I cry to make you smile
Even though we may not know every side of each other
I want to make you smile more
I want to know you longer
Please remember only the good things, my precious you

With eyes closed
Look at the present
You don’t see your present
Navigating through the deep sea
At the end of the day
We get past that
When that time comes, paint the moon
Big and bright in my dreams

Sometimes I dive into your dream
Though I can’t stay there forever
Sometimes I cry to make you smile
Even though we may not know every side of each other
I want to make you smile more
I want to know you longer
Please remember only the good things,
My precious one, you
